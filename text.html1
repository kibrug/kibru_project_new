<p>A single event on a single day changed the world.</p> <p>It was October 31,1517.
Brother Martin, a monk and a scholar,
had struggled for years with his 
church, the church in Rome.</p> <p>He had been greatly disturbed by an 
unprecedented indulgence sale.</p>

<p>Reformation Day (October 31) commemorates Luther’s posting of his 
95 Theses on the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, Germany 
on October 31, 1517.<p/> <p>This act triggered the Reformation, as they 
were immediately translated and distributed across Germany in
a matter of weeks. </p> <p>The Protestant Reformation was the rediscovery
of the doctrine of justification—that is, salvation by grace alone
(Gal. 2:21) through faith alone in Christ alone.</p> <p>It was also the
protest against the corruption within the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<p>The century before the Reformation was marked by widespread dismay 
with the corruption of the leaders in the Roman Catholic Church 
and with its false doctrines, biblical illiteracy, 
and superstition.</p>
<p>Monks, priests, bishops, and popes in Rome taught unbiblical doctrines
like the selling of indulgences, the treasury of merit, purgatory, 
and salvation through good works.</p>

Martin Luther died in the early morning hours of February 18, 1546.

His final words echo the seminal discoveries he made, and fought for:<strong style="color:blue">

We are beggars. This is true. Beggars, indeed — because God demands 
 
a righteousness we cannot produce.</strong> One, in fact, that if we could

produce would nullify the grace of God and the meaning of Jesus’s sacrifice 

(Galatians 2:23). Embodying devotion to the sacred Scriptures, 
  
Luther came to understand that we need an “alien righteousness,” 

outside ourselves. We need a righteousness produced and provided for us by another.</p>

<p>And this understanding came in part by means of study. Luther gave himself to God’s Book,

which he later explained as the primary actor in the Reformation. 

The legacy of his dying words in 1546 find their roots in this conviction 

a conviction when bloomed into Ninety-Five Theses and nailed to the church

door in Wittenberg on October 31, 1517, changed the world.</p>

<p>John Piper says we have much to learn from Luther. Originally delivered as the biographical 

message at the Bethlehem Conference for Pastors, this short book presents a sketch of Luther’s 

life and distills relevant lessons for all Christians, especially pastors and leaders.</p>
